# Langchain-RAG

# Description 
The chatbot uses the latest version of LangChain to interact with and extract information from various websites.
A RAG chatbot is short for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. We are going to "augment" the knowledge of our LLM with new information that we are going to pass in our prompt. We first vectorize all the text that we want to use as "augmented knowledge" and then look through the vectorized text to find the most similar text to our prompt.
